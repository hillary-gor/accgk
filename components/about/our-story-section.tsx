                Founded in 2020, the Association of Certified Caregivers Kenya (ACCGK) emerged from a critical need to
                professionalize and standardize caregiving practices across Kenya. What began as a small coalition of
                dedicated healthcare professionals has grown into the country's premier regulatory body for caregivers.
              </p>

              <p>
                Our founders recognized that while caregivers play an essential role in Kenya's healthcare system, they
                often lacked formal recognition, standardized training, and career advancement opportunities. This gap
                not only affected the quality of care but also the welfare and professional growth of caregivers
                themselves.
              </p>

              <p>
                ACCGK was established with a clear mission: to transform caregiving from an informal occupation into a
                respected profession with defined standards, ethical guidelines, and career pathways. Through
                partnerships with healthcare institutions, government agencies, and international organizations, we've
                developed comprehensive certification programs and continuing education opportunities.
              </p>

              <p>
                Today, ACCGK stands as the authoritative voice for caregiving standards in Kenya, advocating for policy
                reforms, providing professional development, and ensuring that certified caregivers receive the
                recognition and support they deserve.
